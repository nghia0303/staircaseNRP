# minicpp

A *C++* CP Solver that implements the MiniCP API. The codebase also implements HADDOCK to allow MDD-based propagation.

# Requirements

To build minicpp you will need:

- a reasonably recent C++ compiler (e.g., gcc 7 or recent clang) that supports `C++17`
- `cmake`

The code was developed and tested on macOS (10.15) as well as Linux (Ubuntu 18). 



# Compiling

To build the project, create a build folder within the root of the project.

```
mkdir build
```

Then navigate into the build folder and compile the code with

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will compile with Debug information turned on. If you wish to compile in optimized mode do instead:

```
cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```

You can, of course, compile targets in parallel with `make -j<#jobs>`

# Example models

There are example models included in the folder examples.  In
examples/mdd, there are models that use MDD propagation.  The ones
used in the paper are located at 

```
examples/mdd/paper/amongNurse.cpp
examples/mdd/paper/allInterval.cpp
```

To run amongNurse from the build folder, run the following:

```
./amongNurse -w[0] -m[1] -r[2] -i[3] -c[4] -h[5]
```

Replacing [#] with numbered parameters.  The parameters represent the following:

- w[0] gives the maximum width of the MDD.  Should be a positive integer
- m[1] gives the model type.  Should be an integer from 0 to 5.     
      * 0: Domain encoding of cumulative sums
      * 1: MDD encoding with among constraints (this is what was used in the paper)
      * 2: MDD encoding with sequence constraints
      * 3: MDD encoding with different sequence constraints (uses a different propagator)
      * 4: Domain encoding of cumulative sums with isMember
      * 5: MDD encoding with different among constraints (uses a different propagator than 1)
- r[2] gives the maximum reboot distance.  Should be a non-negative integer.
- i[3] gives the factor for calculating the maximum number of
iterations with splitting to reach a fixpoint.  This is multiplied by
the width.  Should be a positive integer. 
- c[4] gives the constraint set used.  Should be an integer from 1 to 3.
      * 1: At most 6 out of 8 consecutive work days.  At least 22 out of 30 consecutive work days.
      * 2: At most 6 out of 9 consecutive work days.  At least 20 out of 30 consecutive work days.
      * 3: At most 7 out of 9 consecutive work days.  At least 22 out of 30 consecutive work days.
- h[5] gives the horizon.  Should be a positive integer of at least 30.

As an example, the command could look like this:

```
./amongNurse -w32 -m1 -r0 -i5 -c1 -h40
```

To run allInterval from the build folder, run the following:

```
./allInterval -n[0] -w[1] -m[2] -r[3] -i[4]
```

- n[0] gives the number of variables for the All-Interval series.  Should be a positive integer of at least 2.
- w[1] gives the maximum width of the MDD.  Should be a positive integer
- m[2] gives the model type.  Should be an integer from 0 to 3.
      * 0: Domain encoding with equalAbsDiff constraint
      * 1: Domain encoding with AbsDiff-Table constraint
      * 2: MDD encoding (this is what was used in the paper)
      * 3: Both the domain and MDD encodings from 1 and 2
- r[3] gives the maximum reboot distance.  Should be a non-negative integer.
- i[4] gives the factor for calculating the maximum number of
iterations with splitting to reach a fixpoint.  This is multiplied by
the width.  Should be a positive integer. 

As an example, the command could look like this:

```
./allInterval -n11 -w32 -m2 -r2 -i5
```
